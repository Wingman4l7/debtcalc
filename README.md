About
-----
This script has two parts:

  - The first part inserts your upload "debt" *(if you have any)* next to your current ratio. *(the first screenshot)* 
  - The second part does the same thing -- but on the sidebar of <u>any user page</u>. *(the second screenshot)*

Hopefully this script will be useful for:

  - those in ratio watch to easily find out how much upload they need to get out of it
  - admins who would like to easily tell those in ratio watch how much upload they need to get out of it

How It Works
------------
This script uses the "required ratio" value, which already does the hard work of factoring in the % of seeding / snatched torrents. It is assumed that the user already knows that the higher their %, the lower their required ratio. Needless to say, the second part of this script will only work if the user's paranoia is set low enough so that all of their stats *(UL, DL, ratio, & required ratio)* are displayed. It uses colors from `style.css` to indicate the "severity" of the debt.
This script has been tested on Chrome, with the Layer Cake stylesheet.
